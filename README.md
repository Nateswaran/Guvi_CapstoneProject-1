Topic : YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

The exponential growth of YouTube has transformed it into a treasure trove of invaluable data, ripe for exploration and analysis. This project embarks on a comprehensive journey to harvest, warehouse, and analyze YouTube data using a multi-database approach. Leveraging the combined strengths of SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, this endeavor offers a robust solution for extracting insights from the vast expanse of YouTube content. The project begins by designing an efficient data harvesting pipeline, utilizing YouTube's API to collect a diverse range of metadata spanning videos, channels, and user interactions. Subsequently, the harvested data is transformed and stored in both SQL and MongoDB databases, leveraging their respective capabilities in handling structured and unstructured data. Once stored, the data undergoes a series of transformative processes, including normalization, aggregation, and enrichment, facilitating streamlined analysis and exploration. Through the seamless integration of SQL for structured querying and MongoDB for flexible document storage, users gain unparalleled flexibility in interrogating the vast YouTube dataset. Furthermore, the project presents an interactive interface built with Streamlit, empowering users to visualize and interact with the warehoused data in real-time. In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of a multi-database approach in harnessing and analyzing YouTube data for diverse analytical purposes. By combining the power of SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, it offers a robust framework for analysts to extract actionable insights from the ever-expanding universe of YouTube content.
